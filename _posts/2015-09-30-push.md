title: how to push to server
---

<p>for future reference i want to make this post since i keep forgeting how to push my blog/web page to the git server.</p>
<ol>
<li>make changes</li>
<li>open up the comand line</li>
<li>type "git status" and you will see some red text, this is the changes that you have made that have not been pushed yet</li>
<li>type "git add ." and make sure to have a space between "add" and "."</li>
<li>type "git commit -a -m "your message here"" NOTE! make sure to type a message before you hit enter</li>
<li>type "git push"</li>
</ol>
<p>as a added note if you do anything to the _config.yml file you need to re-serve jekyll</p>
<p>ALSO!! Always pull before you start working! it is a good habbit to have for when you work on different computers or work with someone else. To qoute Cat, merges suck.</p>

<h4>EDIT</h4>
<ol>
<li>make changes</li>
<li>open up the comand line</li>
<li>type "cd /"</li>
<li>go to the folder that containes the site (use ls if needed)</li>
<li>type "git status" and you will see some red text, this is the changes that you have made that have not been pushed yet</li>
<li>type "git add ." and make sure to have a space between "add" and "."</li>
